# MNIST Model Selection and Evaluation

Welcome to the MNIST Model Selection and Evaluation project!

## Overview

This project focuses on model selection and evaluation using the MNIST dataset. It includes code for selecting and evaluating machine learning models, specifically Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). However, there's a challenge â€“ a convergence issue with Logistic Regression that needs to be resolved. 

## Challenge

I invite you to participate in the challenge. Can you fix the convergence problem in Logistic Regression? Your insights and solutions are valuable.

## Key Features

- Model selection between Logistic Regression and KNN.
- Advanced hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.
- Cross-validation with k-fold splits to assess model performance.
- Evaluation based on Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision, and Recall.
- Data preprocessing techniques to enhance model convergence.
- Easily adaptable for other classification datasets.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. Explore the code and follow the Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab instructions.
3. Attempt to resolve the Logistic Regression convergence issue.
4. Share your solutions with the community.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! If you have insights or fixes for the convergence issue or other enhancements, please:

1. Open an issue to discuss your approach.
2. Submit pull requests with potential fixes.
3. Collaborate and learn from the community.
